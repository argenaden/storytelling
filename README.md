# Storytelling
Automatic storytelling 

The main purpose of this project is to describe some story effectively (showing main events in details) and attractively (giving the user some control over the story). The first task is performed by extracting the main actors in a body of story, actions they perform and the objects of the actions. 

Further, using this information we describe the story by: generating multi-dimensional interactive graph which captures out all individual actor-action, actor-object relations (from most to least used objects are associated with different colors) and time series which refers to the structure the story flows, associated by the number of sentences.
